## [Unreleased]

### Added

* MPEG Encode/Decode Support.

  Uses libmpg123 for decode, liblame for encode. Encoding and decoding support
  is independent of each other and is split into separate files. MPEG support
  is generalized as subformats, `SF_FORMAT_MPEG_LAYER`(I,II,III) so that it
  might be used by other containers (`MPEG1WAVEFORMAT` for example), but also
  contains a major format `SF_FORMAT_MPEG` for 'mp3 files.'

  Encoding Status:
  * Layer III encoding
  * ID3v1 writing
  * ID3v2 writing
  * Lame/Xing Tag writing
  * Bitrate selection command
  * VBR or CBR
  
  Decoding Status:
  * Layers I/II/III decoding
  * ID3v1 reading
  * ID3v2 reading
  * Seeking
* New fuzzer for OSS-Fuzz, thanks @DavidKorczynski.
* This `CHANGELOG.md`. All notable changes to this project will be documented in
  this file. The old `NEWS` file has been renamed to `NEWS.OLD` and is no longer
  updated.

### Changed

* `SFC_SET_DITHER_ON_READ` and `SFC_SET_DITHER_ON_WRITE` enums comments in
  public header, thanks @SmiVan (issue #677).
* `ENABLE_SNDFILE_WINDOWS_PROTOTYPES` define is deprecated and not needed
  anymore.

  Previously, in order for the [`sf_wchar_open`()](http://libsndfile.github.io/libsndfile/api.html#open)
  function to become available on   the Windows platform, it was required to
  perform certain actions:

  ```c
  #include <windows.h>
  #define ENABLE_SNDFILE_WINDOWS_PROTOTYPES 1
  #including <sndfile.h>
  ```

  These steps are no longer required and the `sf_wchar_open`() function is
  always available on the Windows platform.
* Use UTF-8 as internal path encoding on Windows platform.

  This is an internal change to unify and simplify the handling of file paths.

  On the Windows platform, the file path is always converted to UTF-8 and
  converted to UTF-16 only for calls to WinAPI functions.

  The behavior of the functions for opening files on other platforms does not
  change.
* Switch to .xz over .bz2 for release tarballs.

### Fixed

* Typo in `docs/index.md`.
* Memory leak in `caf_read_header`(), credit to OSS-Fuzz ([issue 30375](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=30375)).
* Stack overflow in `guess_file_type`(), thanks @bobsayshilol, credit to
  OSS-Fuzz ([issue 29339](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=29339)).
* Abort in fuzzer, thanks @bobsayshilol, credit to OSS-Fuzz
  ([issue 26257](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=26257)).
* Infinite loop in `svx_read_header`(), thanks @bobsayshilol, credit to OSS-Fuzz
  ([issue 25442](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25442)).
* GCC and Clang pedantic warnings, thanks @bobsayshilol.
* Normalisation issue when scaling floating point data to `int` in
  `replace_read_f2i`(), thanks @bobsayshilol, (issue #702).
* Missing samples when doing a partial read of Ogg file from index till the end
  of file, thanks @arthurt (issue #643).
* sndfile-salvage: Handle files > 4 GB on Windows OS
* Undefined shift in `dyn_get_32bit`(), credit to OSS-Fuzz
  ([issue 27366](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=27366)).
* Integer overflow in `nms_adpcm_update`(), credit to OSS-Fuzz
  ([issue 25522](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25522)).
* ABI version incompatibility between Autotools and CMake build on Apple
  platforms.

  Now ABI must be compatible with Autotools builds. Note that this change
  requires CMake >= 3.17 for building dylib on Apple platforms.

* Fix build with Autotools + MinGW toolchain on Windows platform.

  See https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/issues/5803 for details.

### Security

* Heap buffer overflow in `wavlike_ima_decode_block`(), thanks @bobsayshilol,

  credit to OSS-Fuzz ([issue 26026](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=26026)).
* Index out of bounds in `psf_nms_adpcm_decode_block`(), credit to OSS-Fuzz
  ([issue 25561](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25561)).
